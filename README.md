# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using supervised machine learning models. The dataset contains various features like passenger class, age, sex, and other personal details, and the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

The following machine learning models have been implemented and evaluated:

- *Logistic Regression*
- *Random Forest Classifier*
- *Neural Network* (using TensorFlow)
